- Your application’s Github repo should have more than **30 watchers, 75 stars and 30 watchers and should be more than 30 days old**
  - https://docs.brew.sh/Acceptable-Formulae#niche-or-self-submitted-stuff
- Package with Homebrew https://docs.brew.sh/Formula-Cookbook
- As of Homebrew 4.0.0, formulae are downloaded as JSON from https://formulae.brew.sh which is automatically regenerated by a scheduled Homebrew/formulae.brew.sh job from the master branch of the Homebrew/homebrew-core repository.
- Homebrew installs formulae to the Cellar at $(brew --cellar) 
- and then symlinks some of the installation into the prefix at $(brew --prefix) (e.g. /opt/homebrew) so that other programs can see what’s going on. We suggest running brew ls on a few of the kegs in your Cellar to see how it is all arranged.
- Simple example: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/e/etl.rb
- Acceptable Formulae requirements
  - isn’t already in Homebrew (check brew search <formula>)
  - isn’t already waiting to be merged (check the issue tracker)
  - is still supported by upstream (i.e. doesn’t require extensive patching)
  - [todo] has a stable, tagged version (i.e. isn’t just a GitHub repository with no versions)
  - [whuut?] passes all brew audit --new --formula <formula> tests
- Basically I will need to create a PR to the brew-core github https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request
  - How do you make sure it will make the cut?
  - Create a custom tap?
